### Framing the Business Scenario

This project aims to reveiw data and provide insights that would be valuable to the CEO and CMO. The Business has been performing well and the management wants to analyse what the major
contributing factors are to the revenue so that they can strategically plan for the following year.

The leadership is interested in viewing the metrics from both an operations and marketing perspective. Management also intends to expand the business and is interested in seeking guidance
into areas that are performing well so they can keep a clear focus on what's working.

To achieve this will tackle the following prompts:

2. View the top 10 countries which are generating the highest revenue. This will enable them make decisions on which areas to focus on.
3. View the quantity sold along with the revenue generated. We will achieve this by creating bar graphs
4. View the top 10 customers by reveneue. This will enable the CMO understand their customers and target the higher revenue gerating customers and ensure that they remain satisfied with their products
